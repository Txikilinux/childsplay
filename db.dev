# This file is named db.dev and doesn't contain passwords
# as we use the root user without password while developing.
# For production machines we place a db.conf file in the root
# directory which contains usernames and passwords for the
# dbases.
# The idea is that the DataManager uses db.dev but when a db.conf
# exists the latter is used.
# db.conf is never added to git.
# db.conf must have the same layout as this db.dev file.
# The layout used is the same as a Python ConfParser file.

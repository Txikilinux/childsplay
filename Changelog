childsplay(2.5):
    * Total rewrite

develop (2.2):
    * Replaced SPWidgets.TextEntry with the code from the 
    SPVirtkeyboard.TextInput so that it doesn't have a eventloop of it's own.
    This is needed for the new multiline input widget.
    * SPSprite: Added support to connect to multiple events.
    * Added new multiline widget to SPWidgets.
    * Added a new F1/ticket-create screen for betatesters.

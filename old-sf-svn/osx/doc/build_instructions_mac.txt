Instructions for installation on Mac OSX
----------------------------------------

* Install Python 2.4.4 (later versions may work)
  http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/dmg/python-2.4.4-macosx2006-10-18.dmg

* Install PyGame 1.8.0 pre1 (later versions may work, also 1.7.1)
  http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/mpkg/pygame-1.8.0pre-py2.4-macosx10.4.zip
  
* Install Numeric (NumPy may work also)
  http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/mpkg/Numeric-24.2-py2.4-macosx10.4.zip
  http://www.pythonmac.org/packages/py24-fat/dmg/numpy-1.0.1-py2.4-macosx10.4-2006-12-12.dmg

* Install PyObjc
  http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/software/pyobjc-1.4-python2.4-macosx10.4.dmg

* Install as sudo OcempGui 0.2.6 (later version may be necessary)
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ocemp/OcempGUI-0.2.6.tar.gz
  Make sure the file Constants.py in Lib\site-packages\ocempgui\widgets is adapted correct!
  The last line should be something like:
->DEFAULTDATADIR = "c:\Python24\share\ocempgui"
  If not, delete the file and install OCempGui again.

* Install PySqLite 2.0.7
  http://initd.org/pub/software/pysqlite/releases/2.0/2.0.7/pysqlite-2.0.7.tar.gz
  Take version 2.0.7 because that one is compatible with the SQLite installed by default in OS 10.4.  If you want a later version, you'll need to update SQLite also.
  Do python setup.py build
  Do sudo python setup.py install

* Install as sudo SQLAlchemy 0.3.4 (later versions may work)
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sqlalchemy/SQLAlchemy-0.3.4.tar.gz
  But make sure it is not installed as an egg!!!
  To do this, add to the setup.cfg of SQLAlchemy the following lines:
  [easy_install]
  zip_ok = 0

* Install Schoolsplay (to for example C:\schoolsplay)
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=181294
  Download the zipfile, run "python setup.py install"

* Congratulations, now you can run Schoolsplay from sources on Mac ;-)
  To be able to make an application and an disk image you need to do the rest below.

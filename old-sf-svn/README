There are two versions of the schoolsplay code base.
'schoolsplay' which can be found in the SVN "olpc-branc" module
and 'childsplay_sp' found in the "childsplay_sp" module.
The "cognitionplay" module is just a themed childsplay_sp version.

Beware that the sources can't be installed with the setup.py scripts.
These scripts are meant to be used from within a release package.
Contact stas.zytkiewicz@gmail.com if you want to install form
sources. (I assume you know why you want to do that :-)

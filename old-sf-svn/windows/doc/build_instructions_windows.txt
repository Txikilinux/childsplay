Instructions for installation on Windows
----------------------------------------

In short:
* Install all dependencies:
  Python, SQLAlchemy, PySQLite, PyGame, numpy, GTK, PyCairo, PyGObject, PyGTK

* Download & unzip Childsplay, Cognitionplay or Schoolsplay

* Copy appropriate "Windows" dir from SVN to unzipped package

* Install Childsplay or Cognitionplay or Schoolsplay
  You cannot install Childsplay and Cognitionplay at the same time!
  They can be installed in seperate directories, but SPCore will be installed in your Python packages dir
  SPCore also contains the name "Childsplay" or "Cognitionplay"!

* Rename the dir "locale" to "locales" (GTK problem in combo with Py2Exe)

* Install language sound files

* Run!



In long:

Needed for the Schoolsplay backend:
-----------------------------------

* Install Python 2.4.4 (later versions may work)
  http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/python-2.4.4.msi

* Install SQLAlchemy 0.4 (later versions may work)
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sqlalchemy/SQLAlchemy-0.4.8.tar.gz
  But make sure it is not installed as an egg!!!
  To do this, add to the setup.cfg of SQLAlchemy the following lines:
  [easy_install]
  zip_ok = 0

* If you are not using Python2.5, you have to install PySQLite
  http://initd.org/pub/software/pysqlite/releases/2.3/2.3.5/pysqlite-2.3.5.win32-py2.4.exe

* Install GTK 2.10.11 Runtime Environment (later versions may work)
  http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/modules/news/

* Install PyCairo 1.2 (later versions may work)
  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pycairo/

* Install PyGObject 2.12 (later versions may work)
  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygobject/

* Install PyGtk 2.10 (later versions may work)
  http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/

* Install NumPy 1.2.1 (later versions may work)
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=175103


For the PyGame version (Childsplay & Cognitionplay):
----------------------------------------------------
  
* Install PyGame 1.8.1 (later versions may work)
  http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.8.1release.win32-py2.4.msi

* Install Numpy which is needed by PyGame (OcempGui
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/numpy/numpy-1.2.1-win32-superpack-python2.4.exe

Install Childsplay itself:
--------------------------

* Install Childsplay
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=181294&package_id=247356
  Unzip the zip file and change setup.py, line 65 to
  PREFIX = 'C:\Childsplay_sp' (for example)

* Add the Windows directory to the unzipped package:
  http://schoolsplay.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/schoolsplay/branches/childsplay_sp/windows/
  Especially SPBasePaths.py is needed!

* Run "python setup.py install" in a command prompt on the path

* Rename C:\Childsplay_sp\share\locale to C:\Childsplay_sp\share\locales
  This is needed because SPBasePaths.py points to it.
  And the root cause is because both GTK and Childsplay_sp want to write the same files to the same dir when running py2exe

* Install appropriate (or all) language sound files from
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=181294&package_id=230927
  to C:\Childsplay_sp\share\sp_alphabetsounds\

* Congratulations, now you can execute Childsplay_sp from sources on Windows ;-)


Install Cognitionplay itself:
-----------------------------

* Install Cognitionplay
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=181294&package_id=252775
  Unzip the zip file and change setup.py, line 65 to
  PREFIX = 'C:\Cognitionplay' (for example)

* Add the Windows directory to the unzipped package:
  http://schoolsplay.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/schoolsplay/branches/cognitionplay/windows/
  Especially SPBasePaths.py is needed!

* Run "python setup.py install" in a command prompt on the path

* Rename C:\Cognitionplay\share\locale to C:\Cognitionplay\share\locales
  This is needed because SPBasePaths.py points to it.
  And the root cause is because both GTK and Cognitionplay want to write the same files to the same dir when running py2exe

* Install appropriate (or all) language sound files from
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=181294&package_id=230927
  to C:\Cognitionplay\share\sp_alphabetsounds\

* Congratulations, now you can execute Cognitionplay from sources on Windows ;-)

* Be reminded that you cannot run Childsplay and Cognitionplay from sources at the same time!


Install SchoolsPlay itself:
---------------------------

* Install Schoolsplay





Common instructions for building a .exe on Windows:
---------------------------------------------------

* Add the systemvariable PYTHONPATH to your system environment.
  It should point of course to your python installation, example: C:\Python24

* Install Py2Exe 0.6.6 (later versions may work)
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/py2exe/py2exe-0.6.6.win32-py2.4.exe

  When you build an exe and it fails, Py2Exe writes a log file.
  Unfortunately it does an append to this log file iso writing a new file.
  Since this file can become quite big, best is to write a new file.
  In the  ...Python24\Lib\site-packages\py2exe\boot_common.py change line 53 from
  self._file = open(fname, 'a') to
  self._file = open(fname, 'w')

* Install InnoSetup and extra languages
  http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
  At the moment the installation path of InnoSetup (c:\Program\InnoSetup) is hardcoded in setup.py
  Normally this is C:\Program Files\InnoSetup, if that is the case, change line 185 from
  "cmd = "C:\Programs\Innose~1\Compil32.exe /cc " + setupfile" to
  "cmd = "C:\Progra~1\Innose~1\Compil32.exe /cc " + setupfile"


Instructions for building Childsplay.exe on Windows:
----------------------------------------------------

* Copy generic.iss, setup.py from 
  http://schoolsplay.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/schoolsplay/branches/childsplay_sp/windows/
  to the directory where you installed Childsplay (C:\Childsplay_sp)
  Now run python setup.py py2exe
  You should end up with a childsplay.exe in C:\Childsplay_sp\dist\
  and an installer in C:\Childsplay_sp\dist\installer\


Instructions for building Cognitionplay.exe on Windows:
-------------------------------------------------------

* Copy generic.iss, setup.py from 
  http://schoolsplay.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/schoolsplay/branches/cognitionplay/windows/
  to the directory where you installed Cognitionplay (C:\Cognitionplay)
  Now run python setup.py py2exe
  You should end up with a cognitionplay.exe in C:\Cognitionplay\dist\
  and an installer in C:\Cognitionplay\dist\installer\

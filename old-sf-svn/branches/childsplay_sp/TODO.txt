For CGP we need a different named SQLTables module 
This is needed when CGP and CP differ in the activities.

Do like Chris suggested:
Chris: In the alphabet sounds activity, you do first the numbers
 on a row, then the numbers random on the screen and
 then the letters.
I would do the numbers like you do and then the letters 
either alphabetically or layed out like the used keyboard.
And then random on the screen
Going from 10 characters to 26 is a big step

Here's which graphics we need, or need updating, for the new childsplay 2.0.

There no release yet but everything lives in SVN branch 'childsplay2'.
Just contact me if you want existing pictures and I email them to you.

---------- Activities ----------------
Memory:
The memory game has four difficulty levels within each level.
Difficulty 1 has pictures that are easy to remember and are totally different from each other like a car a cow etc. (We have these)
Difficulty 2 has pictures that are less easy to remember for example and look somewhat the
same like animals that are drawn is a similar fashion. (we have these)
Difficulty 3 has pictures that more difficult like letters.
Difficulty 4 has abstract pictures in similar colors and which looks very much alike.

---------------------------------------
Electro:
The new 'electro' game is a game where one has to find the two pictures that are associated like a light bulb and a lamp etc. These images must be named 001A.png and 001B.png, 002A.png, 002B.png etc.
We have these from gcompris but they are not correctly associated and not some pictures are a bit ugly.

---------------------------------------
Findit:
The new 'findit' activity is an activity where one has to find differences between two 
similar images.
I have a few example images.
The differences are stored as coordinates in a csv file.
I'm developing a graphic tool to mark the difference square with the mouse.

-----------------------------------------
PhotoAlbum:
Add a bunch of pictures which would be nice for kids to look at.
The whole purpose of this act is that users can put their own pictures inside albums but as an example
we need some free pictures.

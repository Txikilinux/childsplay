Subject: British English alphabet sound files

    
    Hi
    
    I'm Caroline from tuxpaint.
    
    A friend of mine has recorded the sounds of the alphabet and numbers
    from 0 to 9 for tuxpaint and childsplay in British English. The
    current childsplay has a problem as Z is /zee/ in US English rather
    than /zed/ in British English :)

    Thanks
